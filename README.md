# Welcome to the OccupAI mobile app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started after downloading the repo

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

3. Open it on your mobile device using an EAS build (account required). 

The app can currently be run on Android emulator or a physical Android device. However, these require an EAS build and firebase credentials since the application is in development mode and not production mode.
For security, we have removed our own credentials from this project since it is a paid Firebase console plan and would be publicly available here.
